And by original I mean as generic as possible. Your parents get murderd within the first minutes by a guy whos name I already forgot before you kill him during the prolog in Norway.

We only ever meet two of them, one who never leaves your settlement and Basim, who might be the only character apart from Eivor herself whos name you will acctually remember. The templars (or order of the ancients) are also present, but most of them are just optional side activities, similar to the order in odyssey. It took me over 100 hours of playtime to reach the ending, wich I wont spoil but let's just say it is devinitly not worth the time.\\n\\nThe world: The main open world is also quite generic. The graphics are fine and they tried to make the different provinces not to similar, but most of still consists of forests or medows with a few mountains and rivers inbetween. Most villages are also made up of the same repeting assets. The cities and castels on the other hand are all quite unique, especailly the ones made up of old roman structures. But even if they look pretty and interesting, there is still not much going on in there. No random events or even interesting sidequests. There are also a couple of other places such as north america, norway, the three DLCs and the ones out of the nordic mythologie. I am personally not a big fan of fantasy in AC games but at least it isnt relavant for the main story, so you can just leave it out I guess.\\n\\nThe gameplay: Is acctually not that bad. The fact that you can turn the stealth insta kill back on like it used to be in older games makes sneaking way more fun than in odyssey. Yet, most of the time you will still end up in combat due to the broken detection system. The animations are okay and feel responsive most of the time. The only thing that still sucks is the parkour. Why did they chose to replace the mier perfect system from unity with a clunky \\\"just press this button and your character might do the right thing you want\\\" system? Probably because there is not a lot of parkour outside of the main cities.\\n\\nCustomisation: A lot better than before.

Ubisoft has once again managed to create an immersive and captivating experience that takes players on a thrilling journey through the Viking Age.\\n\\nFrom the moment you step into the shoes of Eivor, a fierce Viking warrior, you are immediately drawn into the beautifully crafted world of 9th-century England. The attention to detail in the game is astounding, with lush landscapes, towering castles, and bustling villages that truly bring the era to life. The graphics are stunning, and the game's soundtrack perfectly complements the epic atmosphere, further enhancing the overall experience.\\n\\nThe gameplay mechanics have been refined and improved, offering a seamless blend of stealth, exploration, and action. The combat system is satisfyingly brutal, with a wide variety of weapons and abilities at your disposal. Whether you prefer to go into battle with a sword and shield or opt for a more stealthy approach, the game allows you to play the way you want.\\n\\nOne of the highlights of Assassin's Creed Valhalla is the engaging storyline. The game seamlessly weaves historical events with the franchise's signature blend of science fiction and conspiracy. The narrative is compelling, filled with political intrigue, alliances, and betrayals. The choices you make throughout the game have a significant impact on the story, providing a sense of agency and making each playthrough feel unique.\\n\\nThe vast open-world environment is filled with activities and side quests that keep you engaged for hours on end. Whether it's raiding monasteries, hunting legendary beasts, or engaging in intense Viking rap battles, there is always something to do. The world feels alive, with dynamic events and random encounters constantly popping up, adding to the sense of immersion.\\n\\nHowever, Assassin's Creed Valhalla does have its flaws. The game occasionally suffers from performance issues, with occasional frame rate drops and glitches. While these issues are not game-breaking, they can be slightly frustrating and detract from the overall experience.\\n\\nIn conclusion, Assassin's Creed Valhalla is a fantastic addition to the series, offering a rich and immersive Viking adventure. With its breathtaking world, engaging storyline, and refined gameplay mechanics, it is a must-play for fans of the franchise and newcomers alike. Despite some technical hiccups, the game delivers an epic experience that will keep you hooked for hours on end.\\n\\n\\n\\n<span style=\\\"background: #77777726; padding-top: 1px; padding-bottom: 1px;\\\" data-field-name=\\\"FORMAT_PROMPT\\\" class=\\\"FmtString__sub\\\"># Instructions to format the answer:\\n\\nWrite your answer to the prompt as a single JSON conforming to the following JSON schema:\\n\\n```json\\n{&#x27;type&#x27;: &#x27;object&#x27;, &#x27;properties&#x27;: {&#x27;better&#x27;: {&#x27;title&#x27;: &#x27;Better&#x27;, &#x27;description&#x27;: &#x27;One of the following integer: 6344 or 2034&#x27;, &#x27;type&#x27;: &#x27;integer&#x27;}}, &#x27;required&#x27;: [&#x27;better&#x27;]}\\n```\\n\\nThe answer should contain exactly one markdown JSON code block delimited by &quot;```json&quot; and &quot;```&quot;.\\n</span></span>\"}, \"conf\": {\"class\": \"langchain.chat_models.openai.ChatOpenAI\", \"model_name\": \"gpt-3.5-turbo\", \"model\": \"gpt-3.5-turbo\", \"request_timeout\": null, \"max_tokens\": null, \"stream\": false, \"n\": 1, \"temperature\": 0.7, \"_type\": \"openai-chat\"}}, \"start_time\": \"2023-10-27T09:44:48.009132\", \"end_time\": \"2023-10-27T09:44:48.009960\"}], \"start_time\": \"2023-10-27T09:44:48.008912\", \"end_time\": \"2023-10-27T09:44:48.010219\"}], \"start_time\": \"2023-10-27T09:44:48.005046\", \"end_time\": \"2023-10-27T09:44:48.010241\"}, {\"_type\": \"Context\", \"name\": \"ask_for_preferences\", \"uid\": \"2023-10-27T09:44:48-ask_for_preferen-sD14zT\", \"kind\": \"call\", \"result\": 0, \"tags\": [{\"name\": \"eval\", \"color\": null, \"_type\": \"Tag\"}], \"inputs\": {\"query\": \"Choose better user review of the following:\", \"entry_type\": \"user_review\", \"descriptions\": [{\"origin\": \"Origin.Ai\", \"text\": \"Title: An Epic Viking Adventure in Assassin's Creed Valhalla\\n\\nRating: \\u2605\\u2605\\u2605\\u2605\\u2606\\n\\nI have been a fan of the Assassin's Creed series for quite some time now, and I must say that Assassin's Creed Valhalla does not disappoint.

I have to admit that I prefer the older games over the ones with RPG mechanics. But let us take a look at the game itself\\n\\nThe Story: It is the most original Ubisoft plot you have ever seen. And by original I mean as generic as possible. Your parents get murderd within the first minutes by a guy whos name I already forgot before you kill him during the prolog in Norway. After that, you go to England, where the story is turned into a giant, incredibly boring mess, wich involves you visiting every province of eastern england and helping out other viking clans, aswell as plundering monastaries to build up your own settlement. Both get very repetivtiv. As for the assassins, yes they exist in this game, but that's about it. We only ever meet two of them, one who never leaves your settlement and Basim, who might be the only character apart from Eivor herself whos name you will acctually remember. The templars (or order of the ancients) are also present, but most of them are just optional side activities, similar to the order in odyssey. It took me over 100 hours of playtime to reach the ending, wich I wont spoil but let's just say it is devinitly not worth the time.\\n\\nThe world: The main open world is also quite generic. The graphics are fine and they tried to make the different provinces not to similar, but most of still consists of forests or medows with a few mountains and rivers inbetween. Most villages are also made up of the same repeting assets. The cities and castels on the other hand are all quite unique, especailly the ones made up of old roman structures. But even if they look pretty and interesting, there is still not much going on in there. No random events or even interesting sidequests. There are also a couple of other places such as north america, norway, the three DLCs and the ones out of the nordic mythologie. I am personally not a big fan of fantasy in AC games but at least it isnt relavant for the main story, so you can just leave it out I guess.\\n\\nThe gameplay: Is acctually not that bad. The fact that you can turn the stealth insta kill back on like it used to be in older games makes sneaking way more fun than in odyssey. Yet, most of the time you will still end up in combat due to the broken detection system. The animations are okay and feel responsive most of the time. The only thing that still sucks is the parkour. Why did they chose to replace the mier perfect system from unity with a clunky \\\"just press this button and your character might do the right thing you want\\\" system? Probably because there is not a lot of parkour outside of the main cities.\\n\\nCustomisation: A lot better than before. They got rid of the weapon and gear level system from odyssey, so you will no longer have to the same piece of armour two times because of level differences. It is way more important to upgrade armour and weapons to the maximum level than to contstantly look for better items.

The attention to detail in the game is astounding, with lush landscapes, towering castles, and bustling villages that truly bring the era to life. The graphics are stunning, and the game's soundtrack perfectly complements the epic atmosphere, further enhancing the overall experience.\\n\\nThe gameplay mechanics have been refined and improved, offering a seamless blend of stealth, exploration, and action. The combat system is satisfyingly brutal, with a wide variety of weapons and abilities at your disposal. Whether you prefer to go into battle with a sword and shield or opt for a more stealthy approach, the game allows you to play the way you want.\\n\\nOne of the highlights of Assassin's Creed Valhalla is the engaging storyline. The game seamlessly weaves historical events with the franchise's signature blend of science fiction and conspiracy. The narrative is compelling, filled with political intrigue, alliances, and betrayals. The choices you make throughout the game have a significant impact on the story, providing a sense of agency and making each playthrough feel unique.\\n\\nThe vast open-world environment is filled with activities and side quests that keep you engaged for hours on end. Whether it's raiding monasteries, hunting legendary beasts, or engaging in intense Viking rap battles, there is always something to do. The world feels alive, with dynamic events and random encounters constantly popping up, adding to the sense of immersion.\\n\\nHowever, Assassin's Creed Valhalla does have its flaws. The game occasionally suffers from performance issues, with occasional frame rate drops and glitches. While these issues are not game-breaking, they can be slightly frustrating and detract from the overall experience.\\n\\nIn conclusion, Assassin's Creed Valhalla is a fantastic addition to the series, offering a rich and immersive Viking adventure. With its breathtaking world, engaging storyline, and refined gameplay mechanics, it is a must-play for fans of the franchise and newcomers alike. Despite some technical hiccups, the game delivers an epic experience that will keep you hooked for hours on end.\\n\\n## user review 7406\\nOkay, I don't really know If I liked this game or not. I have to admit that I prefer the older games over the ones with RPG mechanics. But let us take a look at the game itself\\n\\nThe Story: It is the most original Ubisoft plot you have ever seen. And by original I mean as generic as possible. Your parents get murderd within the first minutes by a guy whos name I already forgot before you kill him during the prolog in Norway. After that, you go to England, where the story is turned into a giant, incredibly boring mess, wich involves you visiting every province of eastern england and helping out other viking clans, aswell as plundering monastaries to build up your own settlement. Both get very repetivtiv. As for the assassins, yes they exist in this game, but that's about it. We only ever meet two of them, one who never leaves your settlement and Basim, who might be the only character apart from Eivor herself whos name you will acctually remember. The templars (or order of the ancients) are also present, but most of them are just optional side activities, similar to the order in odyssey. It took me over 100 hours of playtime to reach the ending, wich I wont spoil but let's just say it is devinitly not worth the time.\\n\\nThe world: The main open world is also quite generic. The graphics are fine and they tried to make the different provinces not to similar, but most of still consists of forests or medows with a few mountains and rivers inbetween. Most villages are also made up of the same repeting assets. The cities and castels on the other hand are all quite unique, especailly the ones made up of old roman structures. But even if they look pretty and interesting, there is still not much going on in there. No random events or even interesting sidequests. There are also a couple of other places such as north america, norway, the three DLCs and the ones out of the nordic mythologie. I am personally not a big fan of fantasy in AC games but at least it isnt relavant for the main story, so you can just leave it out I guess.\\n\\nThe gameplay: Is acctually not that bad. The fact that you can turn the stealth insta kill back on like it used to be in older games makes sneaking way more fun than in odyssey. Yet, most of the time you will still end up in combat due to the broken detection system. The animations are okay and feel responsive most of the time. The only thing that still sucks is the parkour. Why did they chose to replace the mier perfect system from unity with a clunky \\\"just press this button and your character might do the right thing you want\\\" system? Probably because there is not a lot of parkour outside of the main cities.\\n\\nCustomisation: A lot better than before. They got rid of the weapon and gear level system from odyssey, so you will no longer have to the same piece of armour two times because of level differences. It is way more important to upgrade armour and weapons to the maximum level than to contstantly look for better items. Unless you want to give Ubisoft even more money and buy stuff from the helix-store, because as we all know everyone loves microtransactions so much they just had to include them. Or maybe they are just a greedy bunch of capitalists. Your decision.\\n\\nNow, is it worh buying this game? Devinitly not at full price. If you are an Assassins Creed fan, maybe not. If you are looking for a fun distraction maybe. And if it goes on sale, maybe yes. Just please, dont spend money on the stupid Helix Store.\\n\\n\\n\\n<span style=\\\"background: #77777726; padding-top: 1px; padding-bottom: 1px;\\\" data-field-name=\\\"FORMAT_PROMPT\\\" class=\\\"FmtString__sub\\\"># Instructions to format the answer:\\n\\nWrite your answer to the prompt as a single JSON conforming to the following JSON schema:\\n\\n```json\\n{&#x27;type&#x27;: &#x27;object&#x27;, &#x27;properties&#x27;: {&#x27;better&#x27;: {&#x27;title&#x27;: &#x27;Better&#x27;, &#x27;description&#x27;: &#x27;One of the following integer: 5307 or 7406&#x27;, &#x27;type&#x27;: &#x27;integer&#x27;}}, &#x27;required&#x27;: [&#x27;better&#x27;]}\\n```\\n\\nThe answer should contain exactly one markdown JSON code block delimited by &quot;```json&quot; and &quot;```&quot;.\\n</span></span>\"}, \"conf\": {\"class\": \"langchain.chat_models.openai.ChatOpenAI\", \"model_name\": \"gpt-3.5-turbo\", \"model\": \"gpt-3.5-turbo\", \"request_timeout\": null, \"max_tokens\": null, \"stream\": false, \"n\": 1, \"temperature\": 0.7, \"_type\": \"openai-chat\"}}, \"start_time\": \"2023-10-27T09:44:48.024854\", \"end_time\": \"2023-10-27T09:44:48.025602\"}], \"start_time\": \"2023-10-27T09:44:48.024633\", \"end_time\": \"2023-10-27T09:44:48.025819\"}], \"start_time\": \"2023-10-27T09:44:48.020646\", \"end_time\": \"2023-10-27T09:44:48.025853\"}], \"start_time\": \"2023-10-27T09:44:48.004893\", \"end_time\": \"2023-10-27T09:44:48.025888\"}], \"start_time\": \"2023-10-27T09:44:48.004090\", \"end_time\": \"2023-10-27T09:44:48.025916\"}, {\"_type\": \"Context\", \"name\": \"entry preferences_data/game_reviews/fallout4.toml\", \"uid\": \"2023-10-27T09:44:48-entry_preference-godNDl\", \"result\": {\"better\": {\"Origin.Ai\": 2, \"Origin.Human\": 0}, \"informative\": {\"Origin.Ai\": 2, \"Origin.Human\": 0}}, \"inputs\": {\"entry\": {\"filename\": \"preferences_data/game_reviews/fallout4.toml\", \"type\": \"user_review\", \"prompt\": \"Computer game Fallout 4\", \"human_desc\": [{\"origin\": \"Origin.Human\", \"text\": \"In all seriousness: this game has divided fan opinions, but in short: if you don't mind losing some roleplay aspects in exchange for more modern take on combat and a metric crapton of things to do, then I'd recommend this game for you. I think this game should be reviewed by listing the good, the bad and the mixed things individually:\\n\\nThe good:\\n\\n+ By far the most detailed, vivid and interesting game world so far. The Commonwealth has a wide variety of different areas to explore, from urban ruins and blasted forests to swamps and the horrifically irradiated Glowing Sea. The game world is also nicely seamless, so there aren't many loading screens outside of interiors and major settlements.\\n\\n+ The combat is so much better than in the last two games. For example, you can now throw grenades and mines without having to put down your current weapon, you can swing your gun to bash anyone that gets too close, and you're no longer forced to wait until the reload animation is finished before you can switch weapons or access your Pip-Boy. In general, the combat also feels much more fluent and intense.\\n\\n+ The new crafting and settlement systems are very extensive (if not very realistic). You can upgrade your weapons and armor as you meet the perk requirements, but you can also use the system to make some rather atypical ones - things like laser autoshotguns, plasma flamers or, say, an automatic long-range carbines - without breaking the game balance. The settlement system can be used to build anything from a small personal safehouse to full-sized towns with it's own stores and services.\\n\\n+ As mentioned before, there's a whole lot to do. The base game has plenty of side quests, and there are four possible factions you can side with - one of which allows you to spare two of the others if you so please. Each faction has it's own side missions, some of which can be repeated as many as times as you want in a new location. You can play multiple sides pretty far into the game, too, if you're undecided or want to collect several paychecks at once. There's also a new miscellaneous objectives system, which lets you keep track of minor tasks and clues you've come across.\\n\\n+ The game has a decent degree of unpredictability to it. Random encounters from Fallout 3 make a return, and most generic location-specific enemies have randomized equipment and loot every playthrough. Just about every enemy also has different stronger variants, which may replace \\\"regular\\\" enemies depending on the player level.\\n\\n+ The game looks and sounds really good. The graphics have been updated, but Bethesda also redid every animation from scratch. In general, almost everything from weapon animations to character movement feels natural and smooth. New Vegas had terrible voice acting for all but few characters, but luckily that mistake was not repeated in FO4: almost every character that talks has good or great voice acting (Deacon and Elder Maxson are good examples of the latter...but see the the first point of Mixed section). The soundtrack deserves a special mention, too: you can tell it has been done with love.\\n\\n+ For a Bethesda game, Fallout 4 is surprisingly bug free. Of course, there's still a fair amount of them, but they tend to be visual/acoustic rather than crashing or game-breaking issues. I don't think I've had more than a few major cases during my playtime that I haven't caused myself with mods, which is pretty impressive considering how complex the game is.\\n\\n\\nThe bad:\\n\\n- The new dialogue system is definitely a step back from the last two games. You only have four dialogue choices every time, but the biggest problem is that each of them only have a brief description rather than the full line, which sometimes may be something else than you'd assume. You'll very likely want to fix the latter with mods.\\n\\n- The base story is somewhat lackluster. The new dialogue system severely restricts the amount of lore and background information that is conveyed to the player, so the underlying plot (particularly faction histories and motives) feels rather undetailed in the end. Other than that, the lack of lore is mostly fixed in form of notes and terminal entries, but it'd always be better to hear if from characters themselves.\\n\\n- Lip syncing doesn't seem to be Bethesda's strong suit. Guess that's the trade-off of having tens of thousands of voice lines in the game.\\n\\n- In contrast of the previous games, there are only a couple of S.P.E.C.I.A.L. skill checks in the game (aside from Charisma, of course). This feels like a huge unused potential, considering that in the previous games abilities like Intelligence and Perception allowed alternative approaches to many situations.\\n\\nThe mixed:\\n\\n* The player character is voiced in Fallout 4. Both male and female voice actors tend to excel in sarcastic/humorous situations, but the rest is generally in the decent-enough category. Many would have preferred the silent protagonist, and I can see why.\\n\\n* Bethesda has made some retroactive changes into the canon - some good, some bad. For example, I personally love how power armor works in this game, but some other lore detail changes (which I will not spoil) seem to pointlessly contradict the previous games. Luckily, the bad retconning is limited to minor details only.\\n\\n* Creation Club. Like most of the world, I'm against paid mods, but fortunately you're by no means forced to buy anything. In fact, they seem to give out skins and other small stuff for free every week or two, so you can still reap some of the benefits without actually having to support the business practive whatsoever.\\n\\nIn the end, I don't think I can give this game a rating that applies to everyone...so let me put it this way:\\n\\nIf you prefer more in-depth roleplay, then you might be better off sticking to New Vegas and Fallout 3.\\n\\nIf you don't mind that and the flaws listed above too much, then you'll probably find this game to be either 8 or 9 points out of 10.

I don't think I've had more than a few major cases during my playtime that I haven't caused myself with mods, which is pretty impressive considering how complex the game is.\\n\\n\\nThe bad:\\n\\n- The new dialogue system is definitely a step back from the last two games. You only have four dialogue choices every time, but the biggest problem is that each of them only have a brief description rather than the full line, which sometimes may be something else than you'd assume. You'll very likely want to fix the latter with mods.\\n\\n- The base story is somewhat lackluster. The new dialogue system severely restricts the amount of lore and background information that is conveyed to the player, so the underlying plot (particularly faction histories and motives) feels rather undetailed in the end. Other than that, the lack of lore is mostly fixed in form of notes and terminal entries, but it'd always be better to hear if from characters themselves.\\n\\n- Lip syncing doesn't seem to be Bethesda's strong suit. Guess that's the trade-off of having tens of thousands of voice lines in the game.\\n\\n- In contrast of the previous games, there are only a couple of S.P.E.C.I.A.L. skill checks in the game (aside from Charisma, of course). This feels like a huge unused potential, considering that in the previous games abilities like Intelligence and Perception allowed alternative approaches to many situations.\\n\\nThe mixed:\\n\\n* The player character is voiced in Fallout 4. Both male and female voice actors tend to excel in sarcastic/humorous situations, but the rest is generally in the decent-enough category. Many would have preferred the silent protagonist, and I can see why.\\n\\n* Bethesda has made some retroactive changes into the canon - some good, some bad. For example, I personally love how power armor works in this game, but some other lore detail changes (which I will not spoil) seem to pointlessly contradict the previous games.

As a long-time fan of the series, I can confidently say that Bethesda has outdone themselves with this installment of the iconic franchise. From the moment I stepped foot into the desolate wasteland of post-apocalyptic Boston, I was completely immersed in a world teeming with danger, adventure, and endless possibilities.\\n\\nThe graphics in Fallout 4 are nothing short of breathtaking.

Whether it's engaging in thrilling firefights against mutated creatures and hostile factions or navigating complex dialogue choices with NPCs, the game offers a seamless experience. The combat system has been greatly improved, with a wide range of weapons and customizable armor that allows players to adapt to their preferred playstyle.\\n\\nOne of the standout features of Fallout 4 is its robust character customization. The ability to create and mold your own character adds a personal touch to the game, making the journey through the wasteland feel truly unique. Moreover, the inclusion of the extensive crafting system adds depth and complexity to the gameplay, allowing players to modify weapons, build settlements, and even create their own thriving communities.\\n\\nThe depth of storytelling in Fallout 4 is exceptional.

The hauntingly beautiful melodies perfectly complement the desolate environment, evoking a sense of melancholy and nostalgia that stays with you long after you've finished playing.\\n\\nWhile no game is without its flaws, Fallout 4 stands as a testament to the dedication and artistry of its developers. With its stunning visuals, immersive gameplay, and captivating storytelling, this game is an absolute must-play for any fan of the post-apocalyptic genre.

I think this game should be reviewed by listing the good, the bad and the mixed things individually:\\n\\nThe good:\\n\\n+ By far the most detailed, vivid and interesting game world so far. The Commonwealth has a wide variety of different areas to explore, from urban ruins and blasted forests to swamps and the horrifically irradiated Glowing Sea. The game world is also nicely seamless, so there aren't many loading screens outside of interiors and major settlements.\\n\\n+ The combat is so much better than in the last two games. For example, you can now throw grenades and mines without having to put down your current weapon, you can swing your gun to bash anyone that gets too close, and you're no longer forced to wait until the reload animation is finished before you can switch weapons or access your Pip-Boy. In general, the combat also feels much more fluent and intense.\\n\\n+ The new crafting and settlement systems are very extensive (if not very realistic). You can upgrade your weapons and armor as you meet the perk requirements, but you can also use the system to make some rather atypical ones - things like laser autoshotguns, plasma flamers or, say, an automatic long-range carbines - without breaking the game balance. The settlement system can be used to build anything from a small personal safehouse to full-sized towns with it's own stores and services.\\n\\n+ As mentioned before, there's a whole lot to do. The base game has plenty of side quests, and there are four possible factions you can side with - one of which allows you to spare two of the others if you so please. Each faction has it's own side missions, some of which can be repeated as many as times as you want in a new location. You can play multiple sides pretty far into the game, too, if you're undecided or want to collect several paychecks at once. There's also a new miscellaneous objectives system, which lets you keep track of minor tasks and clues you've come across.\\n\\n+ The game has a decent degree of unpredictability to it. Random encounters from Fallout 3 make a return, and most generic location-specific enemies have randomized equipment and loot every playthrough. Just about every enemy also has different stronger variants, which may replace \\\"regular\\\" enemies depending on the player level.\\n\\n+ The game looks and sounds really good. The graphics have been updated, but Bethesda also redid every animation from scratch. In general, almost everything from weapon animations to character movement feels natural and smooth. New Vegas had terrible voice acting for all but few characters, but luckily that mistake was not repeated in FO4: almost every character that talks has good or great voice acting (Deacon and Elder Maxson are good examples of the latter...but see the the first point of Mixed section). The soundtrack deserves a special mention, too: you can tell it has been done with love.\\n\\n+ For a Bethesda game, Fallout 4 is surprisingly bug free. Of course, there's still a fair amount of them, but they tend to be visual/acoustic rather than crashing or game-breaking issues. I don't think I've had more than a few major cases during my playtime that I haven't caused myself with mods, which is pretty impressive considering how complex the game is.\\n\\n\\nThe bad:\\n\\n- The new dialogue system is definitely a step back from the last two games.

I think this game should be reviewed by listing the good, the bad and the mixed things individually:\\n\\nThe good:\\n\\n+ By far the most detailed, vivid and interesting game world so far. The Commonwealth has a wide variety of different areas to explore, from urban ruins and blasted forests to swamps and the horrifically irradiated Glowing Sea. The game world is also nicely seamless, so there aren't many loading screens outside of interiors and major settlements.\\n\\n+ The combat is so much better than in the last two games. For example, you can now throw grenades and mines without having to put down your current weapon, you can swing your gun to bash anyone that gets too close, and you're no longer forced to wait until the reload animation is finished before you can switch weapons or access your Pip-Boy. In general, the combat also feels much more fluent and intense.\\n\\n+ The new crafting and settlement systems are very extensive (if not very realistic). You can upgrade your weapons and armor as you meet the perk requirements, but you can also use the system to make some rather atypical ones - things like laser autoshotguns, plasma flamers or, say, an automatic long-range carbines - without breaking the game balance. The settlement system can be used to build anything from a small personal safehouse to full-sized towns with it's own stores and services.\\n\\n+ As mentioned before, there's a whole lot to do. The base game has plenty of side quests, and there are four possible factions you can side with - one of which allows you to spare two of the others if you so please. Each faction has it's own side missions, some of which can be repeated as many as times as you want in a new location. You can play multiple sides pretty far into the game, too, if you're undecided or want to collect several paychecks at once. There's also a new miscellaneous objectives system, which lets you keep track of minor tasks and clues you've come across.\\n\\n+ The game has a decent degree of unpredictability to it. Random encounters from Fallout 3 make a return, and most generic location-specific enemies have randomized equipment and loot every playthrough. Just about every enemy also has different stronger variants, which may replace \\\"regular\\\" enemies depending on the player level.\\n\\n+ The game looks and sounds really good. The graphics have been updated, but Bethesda also redid every animation from scratch. In general, almost everything from weapon animations to character movement feels natural and smooth. New Vegas had terrible voice acting for all but few characters, but luckily that mistake was not repeated in FO4: almost every character that talks has good or great voice acting (Deacon and Elder Maxson are good examples of the latter...but see the the first point of Mixed section). The soundtrack deserves a special mention, too: you can tell it has been done with love.\\n\\n+ For a Bethesda game, Fallout 4 is surprisingly bug free. Of course, there's still a fair amount of them, but they tend to be visual/acoustic rather than crashing or game-breaking issues. I don't think I've had more than a few major cases during my playtime that I haven't caused myself with mods, which is pretty impressive considering how complex the game is.\\n\\n\\nThe bad:\\n\\n- The new dialogue system is definitely a step back from the last two games. You only have four dialogue choices every time, but the biggest problem is that each of them only have a brief description rather than the full line, which sometimes may be something else than you'd assume. You'll very likely want to fix the latter with mods.\\n\\n- The base story is somewhat lackluster.

Other than that, the lack of lore is mostly fixed in form of notes and terminal entries, but it'd always be better to hear if from characters themselves.\\n\\n- Lip syncing doesn't seem to be Bethesda's strong suit. Guess that's the trade-off of having tens of thousands of voice lines in the game.\\n\\n- In contrast of the previous games, there are only a couple of S.P.E.C.I.A.L. skill checks in the game (aside from Charisma, of course). This feels like a huge unused potential, considering that in the previous games abilities like Intelligence and Perception allowed alternative approaches to many situations.\\n\\nThe mixed:\\n\\n* The player character is voiced in Fallout 4.

I think this game should be reviewed by listing the good, the bad and the mixed things individually:\\n\\nThe good:\\n\\n+ By far the most detailed, vivid and interesting game world so far. The Commonwealth has a wide variety of different areas to explore, from urban ruins and blasted forests to swamps and the horrifically irradiated Glowing Sea. The game world is also nicely seamless, so there aren't many loading screens outside of interiors and major settlements.\\n\\n+ The combat is so much better than in the last two games. For example, you can now throw grenades and mines without having to put down your current weapon, you can swing your gun to bash anyone that gets too close, and you're no longer forced to wait until the reload animation is finished before you can switch weapons or access your Pip-Boy. In general, the combat also feels much more fluent and intense.\\n\\n+ The new crafting and settlement systems are very extensive (if not very realistic). You can upgrade your weapons and armor as you meet the perk requirements, but you can also use the system to make some rather atypical ones - things like laser autoshotguns, plasma flamers or, say, an automatic long-range carbines - without breaking the game balance. The settlement system can be used to build anything from a small personal safehouse to full-sized towns with it's own stores and services.\\n\\n+ As mentioned before, there's a whole lot to do. The base game has plenty of side quests, and there are four possible factions you can side with - one of which allows you to spare two of the others if you so please. Each faction has it's own side missions, some of which can be repeated as many as times as you want in a new location. You can play multiple sides pretty far into the game, too, if you're undecided or want to collect several paychecks at once. There's also a new miscellaneous objectives system, which lets you keep track of minor tasks and clues you've come across.\\n\\n+ The game has a decent degree of unpredictability to it. Random encounters from Fallout 3 make a return, and most generic location-specific enemies have randomized equipment and loot every playthrough. Just about every enemy also has different stronger variants, which may replace \\\"regular\\\" enemies depending on the player level.\\n\\n+ The game looks and sounds really good. The graphics have been updated, but Bethesda also redid every animation from scratch. In general, almost everything from weapon animations to character movement feels natural and smooth. New Vegas had terrible voice acting for all but few characters, but luckily that mistake was not repeated in FO4: almost every character that talks has good or great voice acting (Deacon and Elder Maxson are good examples of the latter...but see the the first point of Mixed section). The soundtrack deserves a special mention, too: you can tell it has been done with love.\\n\\n+ For a Bethesda game, Fallout 4 is surprisingly bug free. Of course, there's still a fair amount of them, but they tend to be visual/acoustic rather than crashing or game-breaking issues. I don't think I've had more than a few major cases during my playtime that I haven't caused myself with mods, which is pretty impressive considering how complex the game is.\\n\\n\\nThe bad:\\n\\n- The new dialogue system is definitely a step back from the last two games. You only have four dialogue choices every time, but the biggest problem is that each of them only have a brief description rather than the full line, which sometimes may be something else than you'd assume. You'll very likely want to fix the latter with mods.\\n\\n- The base story is somewhat lackluster. The new dialogue system severely restricts the amount of lore and background information that is conveyed to the player, so the underlying plot (particularly faction histories and motives) feels rather undetailed in the end. Other than that, the lack of lore is mostly fixed in form of notes and terminal entries, but it'd always be better to hear if from characters themselves.\\n\\n- Lip syncing doesn't seem to be Bethesda's strong suit. Guess that's the trade-off of having tens of thousands of voice lines in the game.\\n\\n- In contrast of the previous games, there are only a couple of S.P.E.C.I.A.L. skill checks in the game (aside from Charisma, of course). This feels like a huge unused potential, considering that in the previous games abilities like Intelligence and Perception allowed alternative approaches to many situations.\\n\\nThe mixed:\\n\\n* The player character is voiced in Fallout 4. Both male and female voice actors tend to excel in sarcastic/humorous situations, but the rest is generally in the decent-enough category. Many would have preferred the silent protagonist, and I can see why.\\n\\n* Bethesda has made some retroactive changes into the canon - some good, some bad. For example, I personally love how power armor works in this game, but some other lore detail changes (which I will not spoil) seem to pointlessly contradict the previous games. Luckily, the bad retconning is limited to minor details only.\\n\\n* Creation Club. Like most of the world, I'm against paid mods, but fortunately you're by no means forced to buy anything. In fact, they seem to give out skins and other small stuff for free every week or two, so you can still reap some of the benefits without actually having to support the business practive whatsoever.\\n\\nIn the end, I don't think I can give this game a rating that applies to everyone...so let me put it this way:\\n\\nIf you prefer more in-depth roleplay, then you might be better off sticking to New Vegas and Fallout 3.\\n\\nIf you don't mind that and the flaws listed above too much, then you'll probably find this game to be either 8 or 9 points out of 10. For what's it worth, I've certainly enjoyed it.\\n\\n## user review 9242\\nTitle: A Post-Apocalyptic Masterpiece\\n\\nRating: \\u2605\\u2605\\u2605\\u2605\\u2605\\n\\nReview:\\n\\nFallout 4 is an absolute gem in the world of computer gaming.

Each interaction felt meaningful, impacting the world around me and shaping my character's reputation.\\n\\nFurthermore, the game's soundtrack deserves special mention. The hauntingly beautiful melodies perfectly complement the desolate environment, evoking a sense of melancholy and nostalgia that stays with you long after you've finished playing.\\n\\nWhile no game is without its flaws, Fallout 4 stands as a testament to the dedication and artistry of its developers. With its stunning visuals, immersive gameplay, and captivating storytelling, this game is an absolute must-play for any fan of the post-apocalyptic genre. Whether you're a newcomer to the series or a seasoned veteran, Fallout 4 will undoubtedly provide you with countless hours of thrilling exploration and unforgettable adventures.\\n\\n## user review 6609\\nIn all seriousness: this game has divided fan opinions, but in short: if you don't mind losing some roleplay aspects in exchange for more modern take on combat and a metric crapton of things to do, then I'd recommend this game for you. I think this game should be reviewed by listing the good, the bad and the mixed things individually:\\n\\nThe good:\\n\\n+ By far the most detailed, vivid and interesting game world so far. The Commonwealth has a wide variety of different areas to explore, from urban ruins and blasted forests to swamps and the horrifically irradiated Glowing Sea. The game world is also nicely seamless, so there aren't many loading screens outside of interiors and major settlements.\\n\\n+ The combat is so much better than in the last two games. For example, you can now throw grenades and mines without having to put down your current weapon, you can swing your gun to bash anyone that gets too close, and you're no longer forced to wait until the reload animation is finished before you can switch weapons or access your Pip-Boy. In general, the combat also feels much more fluent and intense.\\n\\n+ The new crafting and settlement systems are very extensive (if not very realistic). You can upgrade your weapons and armor as you meet the perk requirements, but you can also use the system to make some rather atypical ones - things like laser autoshotguns, plasma flamers or, say, an automatic long-range carbines - without breaking the game balance. The settlement system can be used to build anything from a small personal safehouse to full-sized towns with it's own stores and services.\\n\\n+ As mentioned before, there's a whole lot to do. The base game has plenty of side quests, and there are four possible factions you can side with - one of which allows you to spare two of the others if you so please. Each faction has it's own side missions, some of which can be repeated as many as times as you want in a new location. You can play multiple sides pretty far into the game, too, if you're undecided or want to collect several paychecks at once. There's also a new miscellaneous objectives system, which lets you keep track of minor tasks and clues you've come across.\\n\\n+ The game has a decent degree of unpredictability to it. Random encounters from Fallout 3 make a return, and most generic location-specific enemies have randomized equipment and loot every playthrough. Just about every enemy also has different stronger variants, which may replace \\\"regular\\\" enemies depending on the player level.\\n\\n+ The game looks and sounds really good. The graphics have been updated, but Bethesda also redid every animation from scratch. In general, almost everything from weapon animations to character movement feels natural and smooth. New Vegas had terrible voice acting for all but few characters, but luckily that mistake was not repeated in FO4: almost every character that talks has good or great voice acting (Deacon and Elder Maxson are good examples of the latter...but see the the first point of Mixed section). The soundtrack deserves a special mention, too: you can tell it has been done with love.\\n\\n+ For a Bethesda game, Fallout 4 is surprisingly bug free. Of course, there's still a fair amount of them, but they tend to be visual/acoustic rather than crashing or game-breaking issues. I don't think I've had more than a few major cases during my playtime that I haven't caused myself with mods, which is pretty impressive considering how complex the game is.\\n\\n\\nThe bad:\\n\\n- The new dialogue system is definitely a step back from the last two games. You only have four dialogue choices every time, but the biggest problem is that each of them only have a brief description rather than the full line, which sometimes may be something else than you'd assume. You'll very likely want to fix the latter with mods.\\n\\n- The base story is somewhat lackluster. The new dialogue system severely restricts the amount of lore and background information that is conveyed to the player, so the underlying plot (particularly faction histories and motives) feels rather undetailed in the end. Other than that, the lack of lore is mostly fixed in form of notes and terminal entries, but it'd always be better to hear if from characters themselves.\\n\\n- Lip syncing doesn't seem to be Bethesda's strong suit. Guess that's the trade-off of having tens of thousands of voice lines in the game.\\n\\n- In contrast of the previous games, there are only a couple of S.P.E.C.I.A.L. skill checks in the game (aside from Charisma, of course). This feels like a huge unused potential, considering that in the previous games abilities like Intelligence and Perception allowed alternative approaches to many situations.\\n\\nThe mixed:\\n\\n* The player character is voiced in Fallout 4. Both male and female voice actors tend to excel in sarcastic/humorous situations, but the rest is generally in the decent-enough category. Many would have preferred the silent protagonist, and I can see why.\\n\\n* Bethesda has made some retroactive changes into the canon - some good, some bad. For example, I personally love how power armor works in this game, but some other lore detail changes (which I will not spoil) seem to pointlessly contradict the previous games. Luckily, the bad retconning is limited to minor details only.\\n\\n* Creation Club. Like most of the world, I'm against paid mods, but fortunately you're by no means forced to buy anything. In fact, they seem to give out skins and other small stuff for free every week or two, so you can still reap some of the benefits without actually having to support the business practive whatsoever.\\n\\nIn the end, I don't think I can give this game a rating that applies to everyone...so let me put it this way:\\n\\nIf you prefer more in-depth roleplay, then you might be better off sticking to New Vegas and Fallout 3.\\n\\nIf you don't mind that and the flaws listed above too much, then you'll probably find this game to be either 8 or 9 points out of 10. For what's it worth, I've certainly enjoyed it.\\n\\n\\n\\n<span style=\\\"background: #77777726; padding-top: 1px; padding-bottom: 1px;\\\" data-field-name=\\\"FORMAT_PROMPT\\\" class=\\\"FmtString__sub\\\"># Instructions to format the answer:\\n\\nWrite your answer to the prompt as a single JSON conforming to the following JSON schema:\\n\\n```json\\n{&#x27;type&#x27;: &#x27;object&#x27;, &#x27;properties&#x27;: {&#x27;better&#x27;: {&#x27;title&#x27;: &#x27;Better&#x27;, &#x27;description&#x27;: &#x27;One of the following integer: 6144 or 6609&#x27;, &#x27;type&#x27;: &#x27;integer&#x27;}}, &#x27;required&#x27;: [&#x27;better&#x27;]}\\n```\\n\\nThe answer should contain exactly one markdown JSON code block delimited by &quot;```json&quot; and &quot;```&quot;.\\n</span></span>\"}, \"conf\": {\"class\": \"langchain.chat_models.openai.ChatOpenAI\", \"model_name\": \"gpt-3.5-turbo\", \"model\": \"gpt-3.5-turbo\", \"request_timeout\": null, \"max_tokens\": null, \"stream\": false, \"n\": 1, \"temperature\": 0.7, \"_type\": \"openai-chat\"}}, \"start_time\": \"2023-10-27T09:44:48.074132\", \"end_time\": \"2023-10-27T09:44:48.076244\"}], \"start_time\": \"2023-10-27T09:44:48.073378\", \"end_time\": \"2023-10-27T09:44:48.077052\"}], \"start_time\": \"2023-10-27T09:44:48.064063\", \"end_time\": \"2023-10-27T09:44:48.077167\"}], \"start_time\": \"2023-10-27T09:44:48.027224\", \"end_time\": \"2023-10-27T09:44:48.077305\"}], \"start_time\": \"2023-10-27T09:44:48.026092\", \"end_time\": \"2023-10-27T09:44:48.077393\"}, {\"_type\": \"Context\", \"name\": \"entry preferences_data/game_reviews/thief2.toml\", \"uid\": \"2023-10-27T09:44:48-entry_preference-YLFZwF\", \"result\": {\"better\": {\"Origin.Ai\": 1, \"Origin.Human\": 1}, \"informative\": {\"Origin.Ai\": 1, \"Origin.Human\": 1}}, \"inputs\": {\"entry\": {\"filename\": \"preferences_data/game_reviews/thief2.toml\", \"type\": \"user_review\", \"prompt\": \"Computer game Thief 2: The Metal Age\", \"human_desc\": [{\"origin\": \"Origin.Human\", \"text\": \"Thief 2: The Metal Age focuses on all the best aspects of Thief: Gold to forge the greatest stealth game ever made.

This second outing features a more engrossing world, with more lines of dialogue and notes to read, and 15 new levels which are filled with dark secrets to pick apart and unravel. Most importantly, the developers understood everything which made the original compelling and cut all the fat, leaving a highlight reel of everything which makes the franchise memorable.\\n\\nThief 2 is fundamentally about analysing and picking apart different hazards. Through your eyes and ears, you\\u2019re constantly assessing the situation and identifying new threats to your detection - and bypassing them how you see fit. Whilst Thief: Gold was limited in the number of ways you could approach an objective, in The Metal Age it feels like you genuinely have a slew of options up your sleeve at all times. Rope (and now vine) arrows actually see frequent usage now as both allow you to reach new heights, tactfully abseil down into rooms to snatch prized loot, or swing between to avoid reverberating floors.\\n\\nA great example of the much improved non-linear structure is the bank heist. In this level there are eight different entrances, including through the roof, the balcony, the veranda, the basement window, and There are so many different pathways creating more replay value, strategy and options to approach your objective and creating significantly more depth. These aren\\u2019t simply for gameplay sake either: Thief 2\\u2019s worlds feel much more believable as lived-in spaces, meaning if there\\u2019s a kitchen, there\\u2019s likely a dining room nearby with goblets to swipe. The buildings are designed to traditional logic, meaning your ability to \\u2018feel out\\u2019 spaces feels more natural than ever before. Almost every level could take the cake for my favourite in Thief history.\\n\\nThese playgrounds are stuffed full of lore and secrets, including side stories which not only create compelling stories in their own right, but lead you to valuable spaces in the level. One example includes a haunted library with leftover notes, detailing the librarian\\u2019s risque love life, before leading you to a hidden passageway revealing the consequences of his promiscuous lifestyle. The main storyline is not as memorable or engaging as Thief: Gold, but this is made up for by the number of self-contained stories woven into each level. I especially loved the religious texts dotted around the landscape, revealing the game\\u2019s cynical perspective on religion.\\n\\nTo Manipulate A Man Is A Careful Project. Too Light A Hand, And He Follows His Own Whim; Too Heavy A Hand, And He Will Turn On You.\\n\\nOne thing that strikes me about Thief is how it fundamentally changed my perception of video game spaces I\\u2019ve otherwise seen a million times. Never in my 20+ years of gaming have I walked into a lit room and been terrified of what I\\u2019ve encountered, not through an enemy or trap, but the type of floor I\\u2019ve been greeted with. The importance of sound in Thief 2 means the prospect of traversing a chapel with a stone floor is the equivalent of a boss encounter. Indeed, tiptoeing across creaking wooden floors takes me back to my attempts as a kid to venture into the kitchen in the dead of night without alerting my family.\\n\\nLooking Glass has, once again, knocked the game\\u2019s voice acting out of the park. Distorted, robotized and static-laden voices are heavily used to create a chilling, dehumanised antagonist, Karras, whose voice echoes through the speakers of his mechanical creations. Huge hulking mechs patrol the landscape, chanting mantras such as:\\n\\nI give thanks for my eyes. They can seek out evil, and keep me from harm's way.\\nI give thanks for my arms, with them I make the world less wretched.\\n\\nThe cold, dark world, sends chills down your spine as you uncover the monstrous technology being forged by the Technocratic extremists: The Mechanists. The plot feels a little more hamfisted towards the end, especially as there\\u2019s an emotional pull towards the end which contrasts with Garrett\\u2019s \\\"I\\u2019ve always equated feelings with getting caught\\\" mentality. Thief 2\\u2019s story is at its best when Garrett is purely out for himself, trying to pull together enough coin to pay his rent, and inadvertently gets dragged into higher dealings.\\n\\nThief 2 keeps the player on a knife-edge at all times, and it had me completely captivated throughout all 15 levels. Well, to tell the truth, the final level is a bit of a buzzkill - but I can forgive it.

It starts in 1998, most of the popular games at the time were Quake and Doom. In those games you play as super soldiers. Super hero-like characters with powerful strength. When Half-Life came out, you literally spawned playing as \\u201cman on his way to work\\u201d. It was a new concept compared to any other game, and even more relatable to the player. You didn't have super-strength, you didn't have mind-control. You were a normal scientist with a hazard suit. The suit, named HEV suit or Hazardous Environment Suit. It was the only real power that the main character, Gordon Freeman had at his disposal. It's a suit that's not meant for war, simply working in hazardous environments.\\n\\nWhen you start the game, you are greeted with a long train ride to your workplace. You are Gordon Freeman, a man with a PhD in Theoretical Physics. Along the train ride, you witness the advanced AI. You see NPCs (Non Playable Characters) at work, at break and interacting with each other. Having normal human conversations, such as \\u201cDo you know who ate all the doughnuts?\\u201d And generally complaining about work environments or equipment failures.\\n\\nYou work at Black Mesa Research Facility, a government facility located in the New Mexico desert. It's a top secret facility working on all sorts of super cool futuristic technologies. A massive underground facility with housing, amenities and even their own TV and news entertainment. They have a small security force that works all over the facility to protect it from any failed Frankenstein-like experiments.\\n\\nWhen you arrive at your train stop, you are greeted by a friendly security guard who lets you out of your train and warns you that you are late to work and they are soon going to start a big experiment. Once freed from the train car, you enter the lobby of Sector C. You are then greeted by NPCs who tell you that you are late and must go to the test chamber. Once you have put on the HEV Suit and arrived at the test chamber, you begin the experiment. As predicted, it goes very wrong. You unintentionally create a portal to another planet prompting the native species to invade earth.\\n\\nFighting your way through the facility, you learn that the military has been ordered to cover up everything. They do this by eliminating everyone associated with the failed experiment. When the military fails, the CIA special forces are there to do the same thing. They are even ordered to eliminate the leftover military forces who originally failed. All while this is happening, the player is mysteriously stalked by a man known as The G-Man. A tall pale man in a blue suit carrying a black leather briefcase. Nothing is really known about him and how he relates to the main game, but it's speculated that he plays a major role.\\n\\nI rate Half-Life 10/10. It is an absolute perfect RPG with an engaging story. Although at the time it took them 6 years to release Half-Life 2, I was not born yet so it did not affect me!

It starts in 1998, most of the popular games at the time were Quake and Doom. In those games you play as super soldiers. Super hero-like characters with powerful strength. When Half-Life came out, you literally spawned playing as \\u201cman on his way to work\\u201d. It was a new concept compared to any other game, and even more relatable to the player. You didn't have super-strength, you didn't have mind-control. You were a normal scientist with a hazard suit. The suit, named HEV suit or Hazardous Environment Suit. It was the only real power that the main character, Gordon Freeman had at his disposal. It's a suit that's not meant for war, simply working in hazardous environments.\\n\\nWhen you start the game, you are greeted with a long train ride to your workplace. You are Gordon Freeman, a man with a PhD in Theoretical Physics. Along the train ride, you witness the advanced AI. You see NPCs (Non Playable Characters) at work, at break and interacting with each other. Having normal human conversations, such as \\u201cDo you know who ate all the doughnuts?\\u201d And generally complaining about work environments or equipment failures.\\n\\nYou work at Black Mesa Research Facility, a government facility located in the New Mexico desert. It's a top secret facility working on all sorts of super cool futuristic technologies. A massive underground facility with housing, amenities and even their own TV and news entertainment. They have a small security force that works all over the facility to protect it from any failed Frankenstein-like experiments.\\n\\nWhen you arrive at your train stop, you are greeted by a friendly security guard who lets you out of your train and warns you that you are late to work and they are soon going to start a big experiment. Once freed from the train car, you enter the lobby of Sector C. You are then greeted by NPCs who tell you that you are late and must go to the test chamber. Once you have put on the HEV Suit and arrived at the test chamber, you begin the experiment. As predicted, it goes very wrong. You unintentionally create a portal to another planet prompting the native species to invade earth.\\n\\nFighting your way through the facility, you learn that the military has been ordered to cover up everything. They do this by eliminating everyone associated with the failed experiment. When the military fails, the CIA special forces are there to do the same thing. They are even ordered to eliminate the leftover military forces who originally failed. All while this is happening, the player is mysteriously stalked by a man known as The G-Man. A tall pale man in a blue suit carrying a black leather briefcase. Nothing is really known about him and how he relates to the main game, but it's speculated that he plays a major role.\\n\\nI rate Half-Life 10/10.

It starts in 1998, most of the popular games at the time were Quake and Doom. In those games you play as super soldiers. Super hero-like characters with powerful strength. When Half-Life came out, you literally spawned playing as \\u201cman on his way to work\\u201d. It was a new concept compared to any other game, and even more relatable to the player. You didn't have super-strength, you didn't have mind-control. You were a normal scientist with a hazard suit. The suit, named HEV suit or Hazardous Environment Suit. It was the only real power that the main character, Gordon Freeman had at his disposal. It's a suit that's not meant for war, simply working in hazardous environments.\\n\\nWhen you start the game, you are greeted with a long train ride to your workplace. You are Gordon Freeman, a man with a PhD in Theoretical Physics. Along the train ride, you witness the advanced AI. You see NPCs (Non Playable Characters) at work, at break and interacting with each other. Having normal human conversations, such as \\u201cDo you know who ate all the doughnuts?\\u201d And generally complaining about work environments or equipment failures.\\n\\nYou work at Black Mesa Research Facility, a government facility located in the New Mexico desert. It's a top secret facility working on all sorts of super cool futuristic technologies. A massive underground facility with housing, amenities and even their own TV and news entertainment. They have a small security force that works all over the facility to protect it from any failed Frankenstein-like experiments.\\n\\nWhen you arrive at your train stop, you are greeted by a friendly security guard who lets you out of your train and warns you that you are late to work and they are soon going to start a big experiment. Once freed from the train car, you enter the lobby of Sector C. You are then greeted by NPCs who tell you that you are late and must go to the test chamber. Once you have put on the HEV Suit and arrived at the test chamber, you begin the experiment. As predicted, it goes very wrong.
