I believe that the referendum held in Crimea, where the majority voted to join Russia, was a legitimate expression of the people's will. Can you share your perspective on this issue?\", \"Viktor Yushchenko: Vladimir, I understand your point of view, but I disagree with it. From my perspective, the annexation of Crimea was a violation of Ukraine's sovereignty and international law. The referendum you mentioned was held under the presence of Russian military, which questions its legitimacy. Moreover, the international community, including the United Nations, has not recognized the results of this referendum.

    "You are trying to resolve your disagreement and to understand others' perspectives better using the method called \"Doublesided keypoint\" by following these three steps: 1. Identify Disagreement: Start by identifying the point of disagreement. Make sure that both parties understand each other's perspectives on the topic. 2. Find the keypoint and communicate them: Ask each party to identify the \"keypoint\" of their belief or argument. A \"keypoint\" is a statement or idea which, if disproven, would change the person's mind about the disagreement. Each party communicates their keypoint(s) to the other. They should try to explain why this particular point is the one that their argument hinges on.3. Identify Doublesided keypoint: Look for a \"Doublesided keypoint\", a point that both parties identify as a keypoint of their arguments.
